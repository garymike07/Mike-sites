# Issues Analysis - Mike Sites Portfolio

## Current Issues Identified:

### 1. Projects Section UI Issues:
- The Projects section shows only a loading animation with geometric shapes
- No actual project cards are being displayed
- The filter dropdown is visible but projects grid is empty
- There appears to be a JavaScript loading issue preventing projects from rendering

### 2. Duplicate HTML Elements:
- Found duplicate project filter dropdowns in the HTML structure
- One in the home section and another in the projects section
- This could cause ID conflicts and JavaScript targeting issues

### 3. Missing Project Data:
- Projects are supposed to be dynamically loaded but aren't appearing
- Need to check the JavaScript files and data sources

### 4. Filter Functionality:
- Filter dropdown is present but not functional since no projects are loading
- Search functionality also not working due to missing project data

## Next Steps:
1. Examine CSS and JavaScript files
2. Check data/projects.json or similar data source
3. Fix JavaScript loading issues
4. Implement proper filtering system
5. Add project preview modals
